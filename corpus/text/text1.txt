that fills the stage between composing and performing
writing->reading
with an artefact in the middle
that is somehow considered a piece of music


with two perspectives on time:
prospective time (notated) /
traversal of notation yields performance time (T)
as a diaphragm model of composition.

however there is always an intractable element(s) in a
creative/compositional process / notation process...
is there perhaps a way to make reading-writing less
separatable (like a record needle)
reading / looking at memory also writes or alters it

a queuing system: like a DJ, listened to on headphones
and then deciding when/how to shift into it...
multi-cursor modifications...
